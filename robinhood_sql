Solution:

Here is the solution to retrieve the top three cities that have the highest number of completed trade orders listed in descending order, including the city name and the corresponding number of completed trade orders:To begin, the trades and users tables are joined based on the related column user_id, as the 'Completed' order status is in the trades table, and the cities are in the users table. The city field from the users table and the order_id field from the trades table are selected.Next, the 'Completed' orders are filtered, and the number of orders for each city is retrieved using the COUNT() aggregate function. The results are grouped by the city column using the GROUP BY statement.Finally, to arrange the output in descending order based on the highest number of completed orders, the ORDER BY clause is used, and the results are limited to the top 3 orders using the LIMIT clause.SELECT users.city, COUNT(trades.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM trades
INNER JOIN users ON trades.user_id = users.user_id
WHERE trades.status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY users.city
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
LIMIT 3;
Based on the results, San Francisco has the highest number of completed orders with 4 orders, Boston has the second-highest number of completed orders with 3 orders, and Denver has the third-highest number of completed orders with 2 orders.


SELECT users.city, COUNT(trades.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM trades
INNER JOIN users ON trades.user_id = users.user_id
WHERE trades.status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY users.city
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
LIMIT 3;
